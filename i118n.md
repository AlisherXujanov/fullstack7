# What is i18n and why do we use it?
According to the **i18n documentation**:

i18next is an **internationalization-framework** written in and for JavaScript. But it‚Äôs much more than that!

i18next goes beyond just providing the standard i18n features such as (plurals, context, interpolation, format). It provides you with a complete solution to localize your product from web to mobile and desktop.

# How to use i18n in your React App ?
In this section, I‚Äôm gonna teach you how to use i18n in your React App. So, let‚Äôs do it.


## Step 1: Install react-i18next and i18next
At the point, we need to install all the required dependecies from i18n, or if you want to call i18next. For that, we just need to run that command in our Terminal

```bash
// NPM
npm install react-i18next i18next --save
---------------------------------------------------
// YARN
yarn add react-18next i18next
```
After that, we have all the dependencies correctly.

## Step 2: Create the i18n file for all the configurations
In this step, we need to create the i18n file. So, just create inside of src folder a file called i18n.js or i18n.ts if you are using typescript.
Inside of that file, we are gonna add the following lines of code:

```javascript
import i18n from "i18next";
import { useTranslation, initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
    resources: {}, // Where we're gonna put translations' files
    lng: "en",     // Set the initial language of the App
    fallbackLng: "en", // If the language detector fails, it will use this language
});
```

## Step 3: Create JSON File for each language of your App
At the moment, we need to create a JSON File for each language that we‚Äôre gonna have in our App, like:
If our app is gonna have Portuguese and English as languages, we need to create en.json and ru.json.
You need to create a folder called ‚Äúlocale‚Äù inside of src folder, and then create the languages files JSON.

The JSON Files should have the following specific structure:

```json
// en.json
{
  "translation": {
    "specificKey": "Translated Value"
  }
}
// ru.json
{
  "translation": {
    "specificKey": "–ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ó–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ"
  }
}
```
As you can see, the magic is gonna happen inside translations property. If you have a header title in your app, and you want to translate your header title depends on which language is selected, you need to have the JSON Files equals to that:

```json
// en.json
{
  "translation": {
    "heading": "Hello {{name}}, welcome to {{appName}}"
  }
}
// ru.json
{
  "translation": {
    "heading": "–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç {{name}}, –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤ {{appName}}"
  }
}
```
The i18n works like that, we pass to it a specific key and it check which language is selected and then return the value of that specific key. But if you have {{someKey}} inside the value of a specific key, you can pass a certain text that is not gonna translate if you change the language.

## Step 4: Put JSON Files content on Resources property in our Configuration File
Right now, we need to add our JSON Files Content on Resources Property. So, your i18n.js file should be like that at the point:

```javascript
import i18n from "i18next";
import { useTranslation, initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
import enJSON from './locale/en.json'
import ruJSON from './locale/ru.json'
i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  resources: {
    en: { ...enJSON },
    ru: { ...ruJSON },
  },
  lng: "en",
  fallbackLng: "en",
});
export default i18n;
```
## Step 5: Import our Configurations File in our main JS or TS file of our APP
So, your main JS or TS file of our React App should be like that:

```javascript

// index.js
// ========================================
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { I18nextProvider } from 'react-i18next';
import i18n from './i18n';

  <React.StrictMode>
    <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
      <App />
    </I18nextProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
```


## Step 6: We need to use use that in our React Component
So, our App.tsx or App.jsx should be like that for we test if i18n is working correctly:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
function App() {
    const { t, i18n: {changeLanguage, language} } = useTranslation();
    const [currentLanguage, setCurrentLanguage] = useState(language)
    const handleChangeLanguage = () => {
        const newLanguage = currentLanguage === "en" ? "ru" : "en";
        setCurrentLanguage(newLanguage);
        changeLanguage(newLanguage);
    }
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>
                Our Translated Heading: 
                {t('heading', { name: "Alisher", appName: "App for Translations" })}
            </h1>
            <h3>
                Current Language: {currentLanguage}
            </h3>
            <button 
                type="button" 
                onClick={handleChangeLanguage}
            >
                Change Language
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default App;
```

So, as you can see the magic happens because we use **useTranslations()** hook. For translate, we use **t()** method inside our HTML section and this method receive a key (the key which we set in our JSON Files) and options object that we can pass the text (the text which we set in our JSON Files as appName) that is not gonna translate if we change the language

# And it is done ü•≥üéâüéä
At the moment we are done, and now you can use i18n in your React App
